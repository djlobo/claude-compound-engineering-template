# Claude Code Compound Engineering Template

A complete compound engineering system for Claude Code that transforms developers into confident compound engineers through systematic workflow guidance and continuous learning.

## What This Is

This template provides a complete **compound engineering setup** for Claude Code, featuring:

- **Systematic workflow guidance** for planning, implementing, testing, and committing
- **Automatic learning capture** that builds engineering knowledge over time
- **Quality gates** that evolve based on experience
- **Pattern recognition** that accelerates future development

## Core Philosophy: Compound Engineering

Every pull request teaches the system. Every bug becomes a permanent lesson. Every code review updates the defaults. This isn't just AI engineering—it's building systems that get smarter with each iteration.

## How It Works

### Four-Phase Workflow
1. **Planning**: Structured feature breakdown with detailed task documentation
2. **Implementation**: Focused development with real-time plan updates
3. **Testing**: Intelligent validation with failure analysis
4. **Learning**: Automatic pattern extraction and knowledge capture

### Learning System
- **Pattern Capture**: Successful approaches become reusable templates
- **Experiment Tracking**: Failures become permanent lessons
- **Decision Records**: Architectural choices are documented and evolved
- **Continuous Improvement**: Every interaction makes the next one better

### Reference Guides
Comprehensive workflow documentation:
- `.claude/guides/planning.md` - Systematic feature planning
- `.claude/guides/implementation.md` - Focused development practices
- `.claude/guides/testing.md` - Testing strategies and analysis
- `.claude/guides/commit.md` - Professional git workflow

## Key Features

### Automatic Learning Triggers
- Captures patterns after 200+ lines of changes
- Documents experiments and their outcomes
- Records architectural decisions and rationale
- Builds reusable knowledge base over time

### Knowledge Management
- `reflections/_patterns.md` - Successful patterns library
- `reflections/_experiments.md` - Experiment tracking and lessons learned
- `reflections/_decisions.md` - Architectural decision records
- `future_upgrades.md` - Roadmap for advanced compound engineering

### Smart Coaching
- Context-aware nudging and guidance
- Adaptive coaching intensity
- Quality gates that prevent recurring issues
- Proactive next-action suggestions

```

## Getting Started

1. **Copy this template** to your new project
2. **Review CLAUDE.md** to understand the coaching system
3. **Start with planning** - Every feature begins with structured planning
4. **Follow the workflow** - Planning → Implementation → Testing → Learning
5. **Capture everything** - Let the system learn from your work

## Target Users

Ideal for developers who want to:
- **Ship faster** without accumulating technical debt
- **Build systematically** with consistent quality
- **Learn continuously** from every piece of work
- **Compound their effectiveness** over time

Whether you're a founder building products, an engineer scaling systems, or a team wanting consistent practices, this template provides the foundation for compound engineering mastery.

## Evolution Path

This template includes a complete roadmap (`future_upgrades.md`) for evolving into advanced compound engineering with:
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Self-improving quality gates  
- Automated pattern recognition
- Continuous system evolution

The system is designed to grow with you, becoming more powerful and personalized with each use.
