### Example Entry (Remove when you add real patterns)

## Pattern: Plan-First Development
**Context**: Starting any new feature or complex change
**Approach**: 
1. Switch to Plan Mode (Opus for deep thinking)
2. Write structured plan to tasks/[feature].md
3. Get approval before implementation
4. Switch to implementation mode (Sonnet for efficiency)
5. Update plan with decisions as you work
**Benefits**: Reduces rework, keeps focus, provides clear progress tracking
**Example**: This Claude Code setup itself - planned first, then implemented systematically
**Related**: Links to MVP thinking and systematic learning patterns
