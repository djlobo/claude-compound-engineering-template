# Hello World Feature Plan

## Overview
Create a simple "Hello World" application to demonstrate the Claude Code coaching system workflow and validate the development environment setup.

## Goals
- Validate the complete development workflow from planning to deployment
- Test all coaching commands (`/plan`, `/do`, `/test`, `/commit`, `/review`, `/retro`)
- Demonstrate MVP thinking and systematic approach
- Create a foundation for future feature development

## MVP Requirements
1. **Simple Hello World Application**
   - Single HTML page with "Hello World" message
   - Basic styling for visual appeal
   - Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

2. **Development Workflow Validation**
   - Use structured task breakdown
   - Apply quality gates (testing, code review)
   - Document lessons learned

## Technical Approach

### Implementation Strategy
- **Framework**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (minimal dependencies)
- **Structure**: Single-page application
- **Testing**: Basic HTML validation and browser testing
- **Deployment**: Local file system (can be served with any web server)

### File Structure
```
hello-world/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── styles.css         # Styling
├── script.js          # Basic JavaScript (if needed)
└── README.md          # Documentation
```

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Project Setup
- Create hello-world directory structure
- Initialize basic HTML template
- Set up CSS file with basic styling

### Task 2: Core Implementation
- Add "Hello World" content with appealing typography
- Implement responsive design
- Add subtle animations or interactions

### Task 3: Quality & Polish
- Validate HTML structure
- Test responsive behavior
- Add semantic HTML elements for accessibility

### Task 4: Documentation & Review
- Create README with setup instructions
- Document any patterns discovered
- Conduct code review using `/review` command

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Application displays "Hello World" correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] HTML validates without errors
- [ ] All coaching commands tested successfully
- [ ] Lessons documented in retrospective

## Learning Objectives
- Experience the complete Claude Code workflow
- Practice systematic feature development
- Validate coaching system effectiveness
- Build confidence with quality gates

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Run `/retro` to capture lessons learned
2. Update coaching system based on insights
3. Use as template for future feature planning
4. Consider adding to the patterns library
