# Experiments & Lessons Learned

This file captures experiments, failed approaches, and lessons learned to avoid repeating mistakes. Every failure becomes permanent learning.

## Experiment Tracking Template

```markdown
### Experiment: [Name]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Hypothesis**: I think X will solve Y because Z
**Context**: What problem were we trying to solve?
**Approach**: What we tried specifically
**Result**: What actually happened
**Analysis**: Why it worked/failed
**Lesson**: What to do differently next time
**Status**: Success/Failure/Partial
```

## Active Experiments

*Current experiments will be tracked here*

## Completed Experiments

*Finished experiments and their outcomes will be documented here*

## Failed Approaches

### Anti-Pattern Template
```markdown
### [Anti-Pattern Name]
**Problem**: What this approach tries to solve
**Why It Fails**: Specific reasons it doesn't work
**Better Alternative**: What to do instead
**Warning Signs**: How to recognize this anti-pattern
**Cost**: What happens if you ignore this lesson
```

*Failed approaches will be documented here to prevent repetition*

## Lessons Learned

### Learning Template
```markdown
### [Lesson Title]
**Context**: When this lesson applies
**Insight**: The key realization
**Action**: What to do based on this insight
**Evidence**: What proved this lesson true
```

*Key insights from implementation challenges will be captured here*

## Blocked Attempts

### Blocker Template
```markdown
### [Blocker Description]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Context**: What were we trying to achieve?
**Obstacle**: What specifically blocked us?
**Attempts Made**: What we tried to overcome it
**Status**: Still blocked/Resolved/Workaround found
**Next Steps**: Potential solutions to explore
**Resolution**: How it was eventually solved (if applicable)
```

*Current and resolved blockers will be tracked here*

## How to Use This File

### When Something Fails
1. **Don't just fix it** - Document why it failed
2. **Use experiment template** - Structure your learning
3. **Identify the pattern** - Is this a one-off or systemic issue?
4. **Prevent recurrence** - What rule/check would catch this next time?

### When Stuck
1. **Document the block** - Don't suffer in silence
2. **Analyze what you've tried** - Avoid repeating failed attempts
3. **Hypothesize solutions** - What might work and why?
4. **Time-box exploration** - Set limits on debugging time

### When Experimenting
1. **Form clear hypothesis** - What do you expect and why?
2. **Define success criteria** - How will you know if it works?
3. **Plan rollback** - How to undo if it goes wrong?
4. **Document everything** - Both success and failure teach us

**Remember**: Every failure makes the system smarter. Every experiment, even failed ones, compound into better engineering decisions.
