# Successful Patterns

This file captures reusable patterns that work well for David's engineering workflow. Each pattern includes context, solution, and when to apply it.

## Code Patterns

### Pattern Template

- **Context**: When this pattern applies
- **Problem**: What challenge it solves
- **Solution**: The specific approach that works
- **Example**: Code/workflow example
- **When to Use**: Specific triggers or situations
- **Variations**: Alternative implementations
```

*Successful code patterns will be captured here*

## Workflow Patterns

*Successful workflow patterns will be captured here as they emerge from your work*

## Tool Usage Patterns

*Effective tool usage patterns will be documented here*

## Testing Patterns

## How to Add Patterns

When you discover something that works well:

1. **Document immediately** - Don't wait for "later"
2. **Use the template** - Context, Problem, Solution, Example, When to Use
3. **Be specific** - Vague patterns aren't reusable
4. **Include examples** - Show don't just tell
5. **Update variations** - Note when the pattern needs adjustment

**Trigger for adding**: Whenever you solve something that took effort or could be reused
