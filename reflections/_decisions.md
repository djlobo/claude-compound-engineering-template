# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This file captures important architectural and technical decisions made during development. Each decision includes context, options considered, and rationale.

## Decision Template

```markdown
### ADR-[Number]: [Decision Title]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: Proposed/Accepted/Superseded/Deprecated

#### Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

#### Decision
What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: What benefits does this decision provide?
- **Negative**: What costs, limitations, or trade-offs does this create?
- **Neutral**: Other implications or considerations

#### Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated?
- **Option A**: Description and why it was rejected
- **Option B**: Description and why it was rejected

#### Implementation Notes
Specific guidance for implementing this decision
```

## How to Use ADRs

### When to Create an ADR
- **Architectural choices**: Framework selection, system design decisions
- **Process changes**: Workflow modifications, tool adoptions
- **Standard adoptions**: Coding standards, naming conventions
- **Technical debt decisions**: When and why to take on debt
- **Performance trade-offs**: Speed vs. maintainability choices

### ADR Best Practices
1. **Write when deciding** - Not after implementation
2. **Be specific** - Vague decisions aren't helpful later
3. **Include alternatives** - Show you considered options
4. **Update status** - Mark when decisions are superseded
5. **Link related ADRs** - Show decision evolution

### Decision Evolution
- **Proposed**: Under consideration
- **Accepted**: Agreed upon and implemented
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer decision (link to replacement)
- **Deprecated**: No longer valid but kept for history

**Remember**: ADRs help future you understand why past you made certain choices. They prevent re-litigating the same decisions repeatedly.
