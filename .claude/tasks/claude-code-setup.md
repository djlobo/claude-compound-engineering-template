# Claude Code Setup Implementation Plan - Founder/Product Manager Workflow

**Project**: Personalized Claude Code setup for David (founder/product manager → compound engineer)
**Goal**: Transform Claude Code into active coding coach with proactive nudging and systematic learning
**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: 2025-09-05

## Executive Summary
Building a systematic, learning-first development environment using Claude Code as the core orchestration layer. Claude Code serves as an active coding coach with full context awareness of capabilities, relationship dynamics, and adaptive nudging system.

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create comprehensive implementation plan
- [x] Enhanced CLAUDE.md with self-awareness framework
- [x] Model selection strategy configuration (Opus/Sonnet switching)
- [x] Core directory structure (tasks/, .claude/commands/, .claude/agents/)

### Phase 2: Core Workflow Commands ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Slash commands implementation (/plan, /do, /test, /commit, /experiment, /review, /retro, /help)
- [x] Command-specific coaching and nudging built-in
- [x] Quality gate integration with hooks
- [x] Model switching logic (Opus for planning/review, Sonnet for implementation)

### Phase 3: Learning & Memory System ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Experiment tracking structure (_experiments.md)
- [x] Pattern recognition system (_patterns.md)
- [x] Decision documentation (_decisions.md)
- [x] Continuous improvement loops through /retro command

### Phase 4: Advanced Automation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Intelligent hooks system (PostToolUse, SessionStart, SessionEnd)
- [x] Subagent coordination (Planner, Implementer, Reviewer, Experimenter)
- [x] Adaptive coaching levels (configurable nudging intensity)

### Phase 5: Validation & Documentation 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- [x] Workflow validation test plan created
- [ ] End-to-end testing with sample feature
- [ ] Documentation refinements based on testing
- [ ] Quick-start guide creation

## Key Design Decisions

### Model Selection Strategy
- **Planning**: Claude Opus for complex reasoning and architecture decisions
- **Implementation**: Claude Sonnet for efficient coding and execution
- **Review**: Claude Opus for thorough quality analysis
- **Auto-switching** based on context and command type

### Nudging Philosophy
- After EVERY response: suggest specific next action
- Context-aware suggestions based on current workflow stage
- Configurable intensity levels (coaching/normal/minimal)
- No A/B testing - straightforward adaptation based on usage patterns

### Self-Awareness Framework
Claude Code understands:
- **Role**: Active coding coach and compound engineering partner
- **User Context**: David's background, goals, and working style
- **Capabilities**: Full awareness of available tools and limitations
- **Relationship**: Proactive coaching with practical, actionable guidance

├── CLAUDE.md (enhanced with self-awareness + nudging)
├── .claude/

```

### Quality Gates
1. **Pre-Commit**: Tests, linting, security scan with specific failure guidance
2. **Post-Edit**: Auto-suggest next actions based on change type  
3. **Session Management**: Context loading and decision capture
4. **Learning Loops**: Systematic capture and application of lessons

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 1 foundation setup
2. Implement core workflow commands with embedded coaching
3. Test end-to-end workflow with simple feature
4. Iterate based on actual usage patterns

## Success Metrics
- Reduced forgotten workflow steps (tests, commits, reviews)
- Faster feature delivery through guided workflows  
- Better learning retention through structured retrospectives
- Improved code quality through nudged best practices
- Gradual skill building with decreasing nudge dependency

## Implementation Summary

### 🎉 Successfully Implemented
1. **Self-Aware Claude Code System** - Full context understanding of role, capabilities, and coaching relationship
2. **Intelligent Nudging System** - Proactive next-action suggestions after every response
3. **Complete Slash Command Library** - 8 core commands with embedded coaching and model switching
4. **Specialized Subagents** - 4 focused agents (Planner, Implementer, Reviewer, Experimenter) 
5. **Learning & Memory System** - Structured experiment tracking, pattern capture, and decision documentation
6. **Quality Gate Automation** - Hooks for formatting, testing, and workflow enforcement
7. **Adaptive Coaching** - Configurable nudging intensity and context-aware guidance

## Next Steps for David

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test the workflow** using `/plan hello-api` to validate end-to-end coaching
2. **Adjust nudging settings** in CLAUDE.md based on your preferences
3. **Run validation test** with the workflow-validation-test.md feature

### System Customization
- Modify nudge triggers (200 lines → commit, 20min → test) to match your work style
- Adjust nudge_intensity from "coaching" to "normal" or "minimal" as you build muscle memory
- Add project-specific patterns to tasks/_patterns.md as you discover them

### Getting Started Command
**Try this first**: `/help` to see your complete coaching system, then `/plan [your-feature]` to start your first guided feature implementation.
